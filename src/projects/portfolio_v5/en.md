# Project details

Portfolio v5 represents the latest iteration of my personal online presence, meticulously crafted to showcase my design and development skills. This version has been fully envisioned and designed by me in Figma, reflecting a clean, modern aesthetic with a sophisticated dark theme. The entire portfolio has been brought to life using cutting-edge technologies to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.

The frontend is built with **SvelteKit**, leveraging the speed and flexibility of this modern framework, styled with **TailwindCSS** for rapid and responsive styling, and enhanced with the type safety of **Typescript**. A custom API has been implemented to dynamically load project details and blog posts from markdown files, allowing for easy content management. Furthermore, a contact form with automatic webhook integration has been developed to streamline the process of receiving and responding to job offers. The visual presentation is enhanced through hand-created mockups, showcasing my application and design work on realistic phone and laptop screens, adding a professional touch. The codebase is well-structured and maintainable, reflecting best practices in software development.

# Project details

Pangolin is a responsive and interactive dashboard prototype developed to serve as a visual and functional mockup for a
client presentation. The primary goal was to demonstrate dynamic data handling, user interface fluidity, and
component-driven structure to help the client envision their future internal admin panel. It was built collaboratively
within a compact team of three developers to meet a strict showcase deadline — which we successfully achieved, leaving
the client highly satisfied with the result.

The frontend was crafted using **React.js** in combination with **TailwindCSS**, ensuring rapid development, high UI
consistency, and a modern, mobile-friendly layout. The application was structured as a modular and easily extendable
codebase, allowing future teams to seamlessly build upon the initial prototype if needed.

Throughout the development process, emphasis was placed on **clean design patterns**, **component reusability**, and \*
\*responsive layouts\*\*. The project served as a valuable proof-of-concept, paving the way for the production version.
Upon completion of the showcase phase, I stepped away from the project to pursue other entrepreneurial paths and prepare
for my university finals.

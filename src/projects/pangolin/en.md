# Project details

Pangolin is a responsive and interactive dashboard prototype developed to serve as a visual and functional mockup for a client presentation. The primary goal was to demonstrate dynamic data handling, user interface fluidity, and component-driven structure to help the client envision their future internal admin panel. It was built collaboratively within a compact team of three developers to meet a strict showcase deadline â€” which we successfully achieved, leaving the client highly satisfied with the result.

The frontend was crafted using **React.js** in combination with **TailwindCSS**, ensuring rapid development, high UI consistency, and a modern, mobile-friendly layout. The application was structured as a modular and easily extendable codebase, allowing future teams to seamlessly build upon the initial prototype if needed.

Throughout the development process, emphasis was placed on **clean design patterns**, **component reusability**, and **responsive layouts**. The project served as a valuable proof-of-concept, paving the way for the production version. Upon completion of the showcase phase, I stepped away from the project to pursue other entrepreneurial paths and prepare for my university finals.

# Project details

IONT Info is a fullstack web application designed to manage and monitor electric vehicle (EV) chargers efficiently. The platform provides a user-friendly control panel for charger administration, real-time monitoring, and performance optimization. It was built from the ground up, including infrastructure setup, microservices deployment, and frontend/backend development.

To ensure scalability and reliability, the system was deployed using **Docker Swarm** and a **microservices-based architecture**, allowing for efficient handling of multiple charging stations. The backend, developed in **Node.js with Fastify**, powers a robust API that seamlessly integrates with **Raspberry Pi-based charging hardware**. On the frontend, **SvelteKit and TailwindCSS** deliver a smooth and responsive user experience, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

A key part of the project was the **close collaboration with the firmware team**, ensuring seamless communication between the control panel and the physical chargers. Additionally, **Linux server administration**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **DevOps best practices** were implemented to streamline deployment and maintenance. This resulted in a high-performance, cloud-based solution capable of handling large-scale EV charger networks efficiently.

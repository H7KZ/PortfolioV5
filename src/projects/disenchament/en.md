# Project details

Disenchantment is a **Java-based** Minecraft plugin built with the **Spigot API**, designed to enhance the vanilla
gameplay experience by reimagining how anvils function. The plugin introduces a new mechanic that allows players to
remove and recover enchantments from items, offering more control and flexibility in item management and enchantment
strategy.

The project was developed with a strong focus on **compatibility**, **maintainability**, and **player experience**.
Supporting **versions from 1.18 through 1.21.5**, Disenchantment integrates seamlessly into any Minecraft server setup
without requiring additional dependencies. It features intuitive player interactions, permission-based controls, and
detailed in-game feedback, making it a lightweight yet powerful addition to gameplay.

Development involved crafting custom event listeners, command handlers, and inventory GUIs using the Spigot API. Great
care was taken to ensure that the plugin follows best **practices for performance and thread safety**, including
asynchronous processing for tasks such as item validation and enchantment data handling. The project is fully open
source and actively maintained, with a clear codebase and community feedback loop via GitHub and SpigotMC.

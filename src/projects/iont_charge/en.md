# Project details

IONT Charge is a modern web-based payment gateway for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, enabling seamless online transactions for public EV chargers. The system connects drivers with charging infrastructure through a secure and intuitive interface, while handling real-time communication between the frontend, backend services, and the physical charger units.

Built using a **microservices architecture** and deployed with **Docker Swarm**, the backend was developed in **TypeScript with Fastify**, featuring a robust **REST API** layer. It integrates with the **ČSOB payment gateway**, ensuring secure and compliant handling of financial transactions. The user-facing frontend, crafted in **SvelteKit and TailwindCSS**, delivers a clean and responsive experience across devices.

A critical aspect of the project involved deep integration with a **master server API** provided by the firmware team, enabling precise interaction with EV chargers. I worked closely with the firmware engineers to align backend behavior with the low-level hardware communication protocols. Security best practices were applied throughout the stack, given the system's financial and real-time control nature.

The infrastructure was enhanced with **CI/CD pipelines**, **Linux server orchestration**, and containerized deployments, resulting in a scalable and production-ready solution for public EV charging management.

# Features & Contributions

**Payment Gateway Integration**: Integrated **ČSOB’s secure online payment system**, handling sensitive payment data with strict compliance and security standards.

**Developed Fullstack Platform**: Engineered the system using **SvelteKit**, **Fastify (TypeScript)**, and **MongoDB**, delivering a seamless UI and robust API layer.

**Infrastructure & DevOps**: Managed **Docker Swarm-based deployments**, configured **Linux servers**, and implemented automated delivery pipelines using **CI/CD** tools.

**Firmware API Collaboration**: Coordinated with the firmware development team to connect the backend with the **EV charger master server API**, enabling real-time hardware communication.

**Secure System Design**: Emphasized security and scalability across the stack, from **RESTful API design** to end-user payment processing.

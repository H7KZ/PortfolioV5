# Project Details

Scorecard is a **web application** developed for CORAC Engineering, built on the **Vue.js** framework, serving as an advanced tool for managing and generating security reports. The application functions as an interactive spreadsheet designed specifically for the needs of cyber auditors, enabling them to efficiently input risk analysis data and export it into formats for end clients.

The project was developed with a focus on **data portability, user-friendliness, and output customization**. A key functionality is the ability to export processed data into **PDF reports** that are fully configurable (including client logo insertion, company name, and other metadata). The application also supports saving and loading state using **JSON format**, facilitating backups and work transfer between different devices without the need for a server database.

Development was carried out using a modern frontend stack. To ensure code consistency and quality, strict **linters and formatters** were implemented. The user interface utilizes the **Shadcn** component set, ensuring a clean design and intuitive control. The build process and dependency management are optimized using tools like **pnpm** and **Vite**, guaranteeing high performance in both development and production environments.

# Features & Benefits

**Professional Reporting**: Automated data export to **PDF** with "white-label" customization options (custom logos, headers), streamlining the delivery of security audit results to clients.

**Data Management & Portability**: The ability to export and import complete tables in **JSON** format. This enables easy backups, sharing of works-in-progress among colleagues, or transferring work to other devices.

**Modern UI/UX**: Utilization of **Shadcn** components and **Vue.js** reactivity provides auditors with a clear and fast interface for working with large amounts of data without unnecessary cognitive load.

**Development Standardization**: The project employs a robust toolset for **code quality** (linting, formatting) and a fast package management system (**pnpm**), ensuring easy maintainability and future scalability of the application.

**Compliance Support**: The tool is designed to structurally support processes related to risk analysis (e.g., for the **NIS2** directive), thereby reducing the administrative burden on auditors.
